# Weather web app
## A simple project written in Vanilla JavaScript

This project was the result of long hours in studies on online courses. It shows the what is the current weather in the searched city. It is possible to check any city around the world. For searches using japanese characters, such as kanji, only cities located in Japan are available. The last search is saved in user's local storage saving his/her time so they don't need to always type multiple times the same city. When a city is not founded an error message is displayed for 2 seconds and the initial page is reloaded.
